                <h2 class="about-title">Usage Token MLN</h2>
                <img src="dist/img/graph.png">
								<p>Our usage token is called Melon token [MLN] and is a core component of the Melon project. It is designed to enjoy a “usage right” to the Melon protocol. To use the Melon protocol one has to use MLN token. This “usage fee” will most likely be imposed on trading and can be thought of as a “tobin tax.  In this way, the opportunistic profitable high frequency trading strategies would cause steady high demand for MLN. The socially responsible " low frequency trading" investor would gladly pay the tiny tax. The average investor would need to consume slightly more MLN but this would likely still be substantially below other alternative solutions. Finally, the libertarian investor would prove that wealth distribution can be achieved in a decentralized way</p>
                <p>All MLN token that are paid by Users to access Melon will go into a smart contract called a “Multichain fund”. The purpose of this fund is initially to secure trustless connectivity to other blockchains as well as redeploying the melon protocol.</p>
                <p>A maximum of 1,250,000 “MLN” will be created before the protocol is deployed to the live network. Following the live deployment of Melon, a fixed amount of new token will be created periodically and be distributed towards the most widely used Module developers. The exact amount that will be created is still subject to further research. A difficulty factor will be assigned to each module class and future inflation will be direct to module developers proportionately. The exact difficulty factors will be decided by Melonport and will be finalised at a later stage.</p>
