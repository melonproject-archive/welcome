              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>Melonport leverages of the Melon Protocol to provide a decentralised user-friendly solution to holding and managing Ether-denominated digital assets securely on the Ethereum blockchain. Melonport also provides you with an easy way to monitor and invest in other Ether-denominated portfolios.</p>
                <p>The Melon Protocol is a collection of smart-contracts that provide the code to set up and manage Ether-denominated digital assets. As a network protocol executed on the ethereum platform, it provides a fully decentralized, self-maintaining and open-source infrastructure which allows Investors to set up their own digital fund or invest in an existing one. Once a Melon Portfolio is set up, a Portfolio Manager can  allocate between ether denominated digital assets and/or portfolios of ether denominated digital assets.</p>

              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>Digital assets excluding Bitcoin have been growing by an estimated 450% per year on average (source: coinmarketcap.com) The total market is worth over $12bn today and outperforming most other asset classes. This suggests interest in the digital asset class is growing and yet there is no simple way to gain diversified exposure in it today.</p>
                <p>Melonport provides the first secured & audited, low barrier-to-entry portal to gain easy exposure to digital asset management on the Ethereum blockchain. </p>
                <p>As a Portfolio Manager using Melonport, your funds are held on the Ethereum blockchain, reducing counterparty risk and making them almost as secure as the blockchain itself. Performance is transparently audited on the blockchain making it easy for talented managers to be discovered.
Operating costs traditionally incurred in setting up portfolios can be significantly reduced by using blockchain technology. This reduces barriers to entry which enables access to a deeper talent pool. Additionally, the cost savings can be passed on to Investors and savers in the form of lower management fees.</p>
                <p>All this can be done using Melonport, which acts as a user-friendly portal to the Melon Protocol.</p>

              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>Developers have the opportunity to develop Melon Modules that can be integrated into the Melon Protocol & Melonport. Melon Modules can be thought of as add-on tools for portfolio management.
Therefore, if a developer comes up with the module that solves an asset-management problem, he/she will receive a fee for life every time that module is used. The fees are set and built into the module by the developer.</p>
                <p>The Melonport portal will eventually enable ‘ratings’ to be given to developer modules and there will be an opportunity to post reviews on the functionality. We expect improvements to be made consistently prompting upgrades.</p>

                <p>Using the Melonport application is free. However, transaction fees may get charged for using the Melon Protocol.</p>
                <p><b>Fixed Costs: </b>The only fixed cost is the gas required to launch your fund. This is a one time cost of a fraction of an Ether. </p>
                <p><b>Variable costs: </b>There are two types of variable costs involved and these are both transaction-based: <em>Core licensing fees</em> and <em>Modular transaction fees</em>.</p>
                <p><b>Core licensing fees: </b>Licensing fees are set by Melon Coin-holders through a continuous voting mechanism.
They are anticipated to be low and can only be adjusted up or down within a certain tight range per time period.</p>
                <p><b>Modular transaction fees: </b>Modular fees are set by the developers. If they create a Module that addresses a popular portfolio-management requirement, the developer receives a commision of his/her choice every time his/her module is used.</p>

                <p>Yes - you can set your fees! Melonport provides a selection of modules for the Portfolio Manager to select their management and performance fees in the ‘set-up’ phase through the use of a drop-down list.</p>

Melonport will act as a filter aiming to select the highest quality Melon Modules out there to cater to the every-day needs of a portfolio manager.
To a Portfolio Manager, Melonport will eventually give you the feeling of walking into an App-store and selecting the modules you need to manage your portfolio.</p>
                <p>Melonport doesn’t charge any fees at check-out, however using the modules will come with a transparent transaction fee which is paid back to Melon Coin-holders or Developers.</p>

              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>Before setting up a portfolio, a Portfolio Manager is required to select a finite amount of digital assets as well as a finite amount of exchanges on which these digital assets can be traded. A Portfolio Manager will be able to request adding another digital asset after the launch of the portfolio but this will be subject to approval.</p>
                <p>This list pre-determines the rules of the portfolio managed by the smart-contract. In essence, all a Portfolio Manager ever can do is trade from this pre-selected list of digital assets to the pre-selected and approved list of exchanges. The smart contracts do not allow funds to be sent in any other way or to any other accounts/portfolios.</p>
                <p>If you are new to the the blockchain space, you also can check if the Assets Module the Portfolio Manager is using has a high rating from the community or not - if so it is less likely that there are untrusted token able to trade. </p>

              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>Blockchains are self-contained in the sense that everything that happens outside of them has to be supplied to them by some sort of outside source (oracles). Therefore, through the supplying of data there is a possibility of data corruption.</p>
                <p>There are two possibilities we can see; Either the data feed provider provides wrong data or the data has been tampered with on its way to the blockchain. </p>
                <p>There are several solutions imaginable to mitigate these risks, from taking a mean of the data of several different data providers to using a service like oraclize.it which reduces the risks of data corruption by the data feed provider.</p>
                <p>Since data fees are linkable to the Core as Modules, the best solution is likely yet to be discovered by a smart developer.</p>
