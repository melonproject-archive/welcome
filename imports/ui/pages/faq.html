            Introduction to PMP-Services

            PMP-Services aims at providing a range of user friendly services to apply the PMP (portfolio management protocol) which is going to be released. These services will include but are not limited to:

            Customised paid services and solutions to traditional asset managers, traditional portfolio managers and institutions including risk management tools, interface, functionality and much more
            Development of a free 24/7 community chat forum where portfolio managers can directly communicate with developers to voice their needs customised modular smart contracts to add or improve to the existing protocol
            The creation of a social media platform where smart-contract protocol can be described in plain english language and rated and/or reviewed by users
            Creation of free video tutorials and documentation

            The PMP is a collection of smart-contracts that provide the code to administer, monitor & govern Ether-denominated digital assets. As a network protocol executed on the ethereum platform, it provides a fully decentralized, self-maintaining and open-source infrastructure which allows investors to create, manage and allocate between ether denominated digital assets and/or portfolios of ether denominated digital assets.

            The PMP operates through the use of smart-contracts. Each portfolio is represented represented by both core smart-contracts and modular smart-contracts. The core smart-contact form the essential solutions all portfolios will require (e.g. the smart-contracts which hold everything together and make the necessary links ). Linked to the core are modules which modify, extend or add to the core smart-contracts to provide more potentially bespoke solutions (e.g. fee calculation and payment, risk controls, regulatory requirements.)

            The financial and time cost to setting up a portfolio using the PMP are orders of magnitudes lower than they are today, seconds and cents versus months and millions. Such benefits will favour all investors, but especially professional and large scale money managers for whom the majority of operating costs will be eliminated (around 50% of a typical asset management firm’s headcount today will be in fund administration and operations infrastructure). These radical cost savings will be passed on to savers who will in ensure lower radically lower management expense. These lower operating costs will also enable new fund managers to enter the market by reducing minimum scale requirements and start up costs.

            What business problem does PMP-Services solve?

            Most individuals or portfolio managers who might be interested in having a percentage of their assets in a diversified digital assets portfolio are not able to understand or code Solidity based Ethereum-denominated smart-contracts. This limits the user-base of PMP to individuals or teams who are proficient in Solidity. PMP-Services aims to provide a plain english user-friendly version and interface of the PMP making it possible for almost anyone to run a digital assets portfolio.
